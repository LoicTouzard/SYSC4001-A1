# Part A

## Compile and run :
 cd PartA/
 make
 ./PartA
 
 
## What is happening ?

A main process (parent) creates 3 other processes : barberProcess, waitingRoomProcess, customerGeneratorProcess

The 3 processes, since we're not using shared memory, the program doesn't work.
The barber will be created and die.
The waiting room will be created and die.
The Customers generator will be created, generates 10 customers and die.

Shared memory will be introduced in Part B.
